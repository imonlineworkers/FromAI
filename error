An unhandled exception occurred while processing the request.
InvalidOperationException: The provided identity of type 'System.Security.Claims.ClaimsIdentity' is marked IsAuthenticated = true but does not have a value for Name. By default, the antiforgery system requires that all authenticated identities have a unique Name. If it is not possible to provide a unique Name for this identity, consider extending IAntiforgeryAdditionalDataProvider by overriding the DefaultAntiforgeryAdditionalDataProvider or a custom type that can provide some form of unique identifier for the current user.
